# DevOps Lab: VM Environment with NGINX Monitoring Stack

This project sets up a **DevOps environment** on a **virtual machine (VM)** that includes a **NGINX** monitoring stack with **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Loki** for real-time performance monitoring and troubleshooting.

# Key Features:
- **NGINX Monitoring**: Monitor the NGINX web server with Prometheus and visualize the data in Grafana.
- **Real-time Metrics**: Use **Prometheus** to collect server performance data (e.g., response time, error rate) and **Grafana** to visualize the metrics in dashboards.
- **Alerting Mechanisms**: Set up alerts with **Alertmanager** to notify when performance thresholds are breached.
- **Containerized Setup**: All monitoring components are deployed using **Docker**, making it portable and easy to recreate.

# Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

1. **Vagrant**: Used to provision the VM.
   - [Download Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
   
2. **VirtualBox**: Required to run the VM.
   - [Download VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

3. **Docker**: Required for running the NGINX monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki).
   - [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

4. **Git**: For cloning the repository and version control.
   - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

# Project Setup


Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/DJENJNY/Vmenvir.git
cd Vmenvir
```

### 2. Set Up the VM Environment

Youâ€™ll be using Vagrant to provision the VM, which will automatically configure everything needed for the monitoring stack.

Run the following command to start the VM:

```
vagrant up
```
This will use the Vagrantfile in the repository to create and configure the VM environment.

Once the VM is up, SSH into it:

```
vagrant ssh
```

### 3. Set Up the Docker Containers

The project uses Docker to run NGINX, Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki as containers. The Docker setup is configured using docker-compose.yml.

Inside the VM, navigate to the project directory (if you aren't already there):

```
cd /vagrant
```
Run the following command to bring up the Docker containers:

```
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
This will start the NGINX, Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki containers in the background.

# Accessing the Monitoring Tools
NGINX Metrics:

NGINX is exposed via port 8080. You can test the configuration by accessing http://<VM_IP>:8080.

Prometheus:

Prometheus web UI is accessible at http://<VM_IP>:9090.

Grafana:

Grafana web UI is accessible at http://<VM_IP>:3000.

Default login: admin / admin (you will be prompted to change this after the first login).

Loki:

Loki is available for logging. Access it via the Grafana interface.

# Files Overview
Vagrantfile: Automates the provisioning of the VM environment.

docker-compose.yml: Defines and runs the Docker containers for NGINX, Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki.

server.sh: Configuration script that sets up the monitoring stack.

nginx.conf: Configures NGINX server for metrics collection.

Prometheus & Grafana Configuration Files: Located in the project directory to allow easy modification and customization.

# Cleanup
To stop and clean up the environment, run:

```
sudo docker-compose down
```
To destroy the VM, run:
```
vagrant destroy
```
